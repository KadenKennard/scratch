        My family has been fortunate to serve missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world. It strated with my Dad being called to serve in Barcelona, Spain. I have never seen someone be so vocal and changed due to a mission, maybe asides from Elder Holland. My Mom served in Boston, Massachusetts where she helped partially transition into having spanish speakers called to the mission. Not too long after, my mission president would be called to serve in Boston Spanish speaking. Growing up, my siblings and I would listen to stories about our parents missions. Their experiences and testimonies started a fire within us kids to serve one day too.

        My older brother served his mission in Guatemala, followed by my sister who served in Mexico. After my siblings returned from their LDS missions, I was the only family member left that had not learned Spanish, seeing that my Dad served in Spain and my Mom is originally from Mexico. I was anxious that I would be sent somewhere like Germany of Japan and be left out on learning Spanish. Luckily, I was called to Guayaquil, Ecuador. For us kids, being able to serve a mission surrounded by our latino heritage was a blessing. Though we were spread across North, Centrall, and South America, we loved the people that we served and developed a greater respect for our own culture.

        As you could probably guess, we all have strong opinions about which was the best mission. Something unique about my experience is that I visa-waited in West Virginia for 9 months, then went to my original assignment in Ecuador for another 9 months before being sent home due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Only serving 9 out of the expected 24 months in Ecuador was difficult for me to accept. However, those 9 months were an eye-opening experience and I cannot believe all that I was able to accomplish in that short period. I loved the culture of Ecuador, ranging from the food, music, holiday celebrations, and overall persona of the people. Watch this video below that will give you some insight on the spectacular city of Guayaquil, Ecuador! Also, check out the interactive graph below to see what countries have the most people traveling in and out.
